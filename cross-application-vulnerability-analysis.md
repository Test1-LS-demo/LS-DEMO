## üîß ASPM Tool Filtering Strategies

### 1. **Dependency-Based Filtering**
```
Filter by: "Shared Dependencies"
Show: Vulnerabilities affecting multiple repositories
Group by: Package name and version
```

### 2. **CVE-Based Cross-Application Analysis**
```
Filter by: "CVE ID"
Show: Same CVE across multiple repositories
Group by: CVE identifier
```

### 3. **OWASP Top 10 Cross-Application View**
```
Filter by: "OWASP Category"
Show: Same vulnerability type across repositories
Group by: OWASP Top 10 category
```

### 4. **Severity-Based Cross-Application Impact**
```
Filter by: "Critical/High" + "Multiple Repositories"
Show: High-impact vulnerabilities affecting 2+ apps
Group by: Vulnerability severity
```

## üìä Recommended ASPM Queries

### Query 1: Find Shared Vulnerable Dependencies
```sql
SELECT 
    package_name,
    package_version,
    vulnerability_id,
    severity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT repository) as affected_repositories,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT repository) as repositories
FROM vulnerabilities 
WHERE severity IN ('Critical', 'High')
GROUP BY package_name, package_version, vulnerability_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT repository) > 1
ORDER BY severity DESC, affected_repositories DESC;
```

### Query 2: Cross-Application OWASP Top 10 Issues
```sql
SELECT 
    owasp_category,
    vulnerability_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT repository) as affected_repositories,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT repository) as repositories
FROM vulnerabilities 
WHERE severity IN ('Critical', 'High')
GROUP BY owasp_category, vulnerability_type
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT repository) > 1
ORDER BY affected_repositories DESC;
```

### Query 3: CVE Impact Across Applications
```sql
SELECT 
    cve_id,
    severity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT repository) as affected_repositories,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT repository) as repositories,
    MAX(cvss_score) as max_cvss_score
FROM vulnerabilities 
WHERE cve_id IS NOT NULL
    AND severity IN ('Critical', 'High')
GROUP BY cve_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT repository) > 1
ORDER BY max_cvss_score DESC, affected_repositories DESC;
```

- Enable dependency tracking across repositories
- Set up shared component analysis

### 2. **Create Custom Dashboards**
- **Cross-Application Risk Dashboard**: Shows vulnerabilities affecting multiple apps
- **Shared Dependency Dashboard**: Tracks vulnerable packages across repositories
- **OWASP Top 10 Cross-Application View**: Shows OWASP issues spanning multiple apps

### 3. **Set Up Automated Alerts**

- Notify when shared dependencies become vulnerable
- Create reports for cross-application risk assessment

## üìà Demonstration Script for ASPM Tool

1. Navigate to "Issues" section
2. Apply filter: "Critical/High" + "Multiple Repositories"
3. Show vulnerabilities affecting 2+ applications
4. Point out shared dependencies and CVE IDs

### Step 2: Demonstrate Shared Dependency Analysis
1. Filter by "Express.js" or "Axios" packages
2. Show how same vulnerability affects multiple Node.js applications
3. Highlight the business impact of fixing once vs. multiple times

### Step 3: Show OWASP Top 10 Cross-Application Impact
1. Filter by OWASP category (e.g., "A01: Broken Access Control")
2. Show how same vulnerability type affects different technology stacks
3. Demonstrate the unified risk assessment

### Step 4: Demonstrate Risk Prioritization
1. Show vulnerabilities ranked by cross-application impact
2. Highlight which fixes provide maximum risk reduction
3. Show the business case for addressing cross-application vulnerabilities

## üéØ Key Metrics to Track

### Cross-Application Vulnerability Metrics
- **Shared Vulnerabilities**: Count of vulnerabilities affecting multiple repositories
- **Cross-Application Risk Score**: Risk assessment considering multiple applications
- **Remediation Efficiency**: Number of vulnerabilities fixed per remediation effort
- **Dependency Risk**: Risk from shared vulnerable dependencies

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Total Affected Applications**: Count of applications affected by each vulnerability
- **Risk Reduction per Fix**: Risk reduction achieved by fixing cross-application vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Impact**: How cross-application vulnerabilities affect compliance requirements

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Not Seeing Cross-Application Vulnerabilities
**Solution**: 
- Ensure repositories are properly connected in ASPM tool
- Check that vulnerability correlation is enabled
- Verify that shared dependencies are being tracked

### Issue 2: Filtering Not Working as Expected
**Solution**:
- Use dependency-based filtering instead of repository-based
- Filter by CVE ID to see cross-application impact
- Group by package name to see shared vulnerabilities

### Issue 3: Missing Cross-Application Context
**Solution**:
- Enable cross-repository vulnerability correlation
- Configure shared component analysis
- Set up automated cross-application risk assessment

This analysis provides you with the tools and techniques needed to identify and demonstrate cross-application vulnerabilities in your ASPM tool, showing the true scope of security risks across your application portfolio.
