- "The system understands which vulnerabilities matter most to your organization"
- "We can see the full context of each vulnerability"

### **Step 5: Demonstrate Cross-Application Impact (1.5 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Let's see how vulnerabilities span across our application portfolio and understand the full scope of risk."

**What to do:**
1. **Show a vulnerability that affects multiple applications**
2. **Demonstrate the cross-application view**
3. **Show how fixing it in one place affects the overall risk**
4. **Point out shared dependencies and their risks**

**Key talking points:**
- "The same vulnerability might exist in multiple applications"
