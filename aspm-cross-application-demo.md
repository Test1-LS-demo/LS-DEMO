## **PART 1: Understanding the Problem (3 minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "Today I'll show you how to identify vulnerabilities that span across multiple applications in your ASPM tool. This is crucial for understanding the true scope of security risks and prioritizing remediation efforts."

### **Step 1: Show Current Filtering Limitation (1.5 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "When you filter by Critical/High issues and repositories, you're seeing vulnerabilities in isolation. Let me show you what you're missing."

**What to do:**
1. **Navigate to "Issues" section**
2. **Apply current filter**: Critical/High + Individual repositories
3. **Show the limitation**: "You see Flask vulnerability in LS-DEMO, but not that Express.js affects 3 applications"
4. **Point out the problem**: "You're not seeing the cross-application impact"

**Key talking points:**
- "This approach shows vulnerabilities per repository"
- "You're missing the bigger picture of shared risks"
- "Critical vulnerabilities might affect multiple applications"

### **Step 2: Demonstrate the Solution (1 minute)**
**What to say:**
> "Let me show you how to identify vulnerabilities that span multiple applications and understand the true scope of risk."

**What to do:**
1. **Clear current filters**
2. **Apply new filtering strategy**: "Show me vulnerabilities affecting multiple repositories"
3. **Point out the difference**: "Now we can see the cross-application impact"

**Key talking points:**
- "This shows vulnerabilities affecting multiple applications"
- "We can see shared dependencies and their risks"
- "This gives us the complete picture"

**What to do:**
1. **Filter by package name**: "Express.js"
2. **Show vulnerability details**: CVE-2022-24999 (Prototype Pollution)
3. **Show affected repositories**: juice-shop, NodeGoat, LS-DEMO
4. **Demonstrate cross-application risk**: "This affects 3 Node.js applications"
5. **Show remediation impact**: "Fixing once affects multiple applications"

**Key talking points:**
- "Express.js 4.16.4 has a critical vulnerability"
- "This affects 3 of our Node.js applications"
- "Fixing this vulnerability reduces risk across multiple applications"
- "This is a high-impact remediation opportunity"

### **Step 4: CVE-Based Cross-Application Analysis (2.5 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Now let's look at specific CVEs and see how they affect multiple applications."

**What to do:**
1. **Filter by CVE ID**: "CVE-2021-3749" (Axios SSRF)
2. **Show vulnerability details**: Server-Side Request Forgery
3. **Show affected repositories**: juice-shop, NodeGoat, LS-DEMO
4. **Demonstrate business impact**: "SSRF can lead to internal network scanning"
5. **Show risk assessment**: "High severity across multiple applications"

**Key talking points:**
- "CVE-2021-3749 affects Axios HTTP client"
- "This vulnerability exists in 3 applications"
- "SSRF can lead to internal network compromise"
- "This is a high-priority cross-application vulnerability"

### **Step 5: OWASP Top 10 Cross-Application View (3 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Let's examine how OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities span across our application portfolio."

**What to do:**
1. **Filter by OWASP category**: "A01: Broken Access Control"
2. **Show affected repositories**: LS-DEMO, juice-shop, WebGoat, mutillidae
3. **Show different vulnerability types**:
   - Flask session management bypass (LS-DEMO)
   - JWT token manipulation (juice-shop)
   - Spring Security misconfiguration (WebGoat)
   - PHP session hijacking (mutillidae)
4. **Demonstrate unified risk assessment**: "Same vulnerability type, different technology stacks"
5. **Show remediation strategy**: "Unified approach to access control across applications"

**Key talking points:**
- "A01: Broken Access Control affects 4 applications"
- "Different technology stacks, same vulnerability type"
- "This shows the importance of unified security policies"
- "We need a cross-application approach to access control"

## **PART 3: Risk Prioritization and Business Impact (4 minutes)**

### **Step 6: Cross-Application Risk Scoring (2 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Now let's see how ASPM prioritizes vulnerabilities based on cross-application impact."

**What to do:**
1. **Show risk scoring methodology**: "Cross-application risk assessment"
2. **Point out risk factors**:
   - Number of affected applications
   - Severity of vulnerability
   - Business impact assessment
   - Remediation effort estimation
3. **Show prioritized list**: "Vulnerabilities ranked by cross-application impact"
4. **Demonstrate business value**: "Maximum risk reduction per remediation effort"

**Key talking points:**
- "Risk scoring considers cross-application impact"
- "Higher scores for vulnerabilities affecting multiple applications"
- "This helps prioritize remediation efforts"
- "Business impact is multiplied across applications"

### **Step 7: Remediation Strategy (2 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Let's see how to create an effective remediation strategy for cross-application vulnerabilities."

**What to do:**
1. **Show remediation recommendations**: "Fix shared dependencies first"
2. **Demonstrate impact analysis**: "Fixing Express.js affects 3 applications"
3. **Show efficiency gains**: "One fix, multiple risk reductions"
4. **Demonstrate verification**: "Risk reduction across all affected applications"

**Key talking points:**
- "Fix shared dependencies for maximum impact"
- "One remediation effort affects multiple applications"
- "This is the most efficient approach to risk reduction"
- "Verify risk reduction across all affected applications"

## **PART 4: Live Demonstration (3 minutes)**

### **Step 8: Fix Cross-Application Vulnerability (3 minutes)**
**What to say:**
> "Let's fix a cross-application vulnerability and see the impact across multiple applications."

**What to do:**
1. **Select Express.js vulnerability**: CVE-2022-24999
2. **Show current risk**: "High severity across 3 applications"
3. **Apply fix**: Update Express.js to version 4.18.0+
4. **Show verification**: "Vulnerability resolved in all 3 applications"
5. **Demonstrate risk reduction**: "Risk score reduced across multiple applications"

**Key talking points:**
- "This vulnerability affected 3 applications"
